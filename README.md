## It's time to make stuff.

**[Shift Engine](https://godotengine.org) is the perfect Godot fork that 
is ready for the future of game development.** Shift provides all of the
[common tools that Godot has built in](https://godotengine.org/features), along
with many new tools. Shift is working hard to take what Godot didn't do so well and
try again, this time with the right tools for the job. Just like Godot, Shift games can
be exported to MacOS, Linux, Windows, Android and IOS, MetaHorizonOS, and many more.

## Your games should always be _your_ games.

Just like Godot, Shift is free and open source. Forks are 100% permitted, you get the rights
to your games with all the royalties, no memberships, no nothing. Shift is and will always be
100% free. The engine also engages with the community, always completely open to suggestions and
ideas. Shift is nothing more than a tool to help us developers make stuff.

Shift is maintained by indie game developer HASCODES who works on Shift for fun. HASCODES is enthusiastic
for the engine, and loves hosting events such as game jams, and so much more. HASCODES is as excited as ever
to get Shift Engine going.
